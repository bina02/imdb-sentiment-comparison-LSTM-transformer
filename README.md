# 🚀 Performance Comparison: LSTM vs. Transformer on IMDB Dataset

> This project compares the performance of **RNN, LSTM, and Transformer** models for sentiment classification.

## 📌 1. Key Performance Metrics
* (Updating results soon... Check back for the final benchmarks!)

## 🛠 2. Tech Stack
* Python, PyTorch (or TensorFlow), Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 📊 3. Data & Model Architecture
* **Dataset**: IMDB Movie Reviews (Binary Sentiment Classification)
* **Models**: 
  - Simple RNN
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Transformer (Encoder-only)

## 📈 4. Visualizing Results
* (Graphs and analysis will be uploaded after training is complete.)

## 🏃 5. Getting Started
1. Install Requirements:
